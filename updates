April 1, 2016: Gary Steffens and Andy Odell caught a mistake in the 'lcin.examples'
file, where the last input block had L1 as exactly zero, which leads to failure.
L1 is now set to 1.0000000 there. 

June 8, 2016: A revision of the 'ebdoc' manual (ebdoc.6jun2016.ps; also ebdoc.6jun2016.pdf)
replaces the previous version. It adds photometric band 94 to Table 2 and explains
the KSD weighting scheme more fully.
 
July 8, 2016: All files with 'dat' extension were replaced with new versions that
accomodate the response function and effective wavelength of band 94. The filenames
are the same as before.

June 19, 2017: A units conversion factor that belongs in two lines
of subroutine LUMP was inadverdently omitted from one of the lines. The error would
affect reflection effect computations if limb darkenings were computed locally but 
not with fixed limb darkenings. The mistake has been corrected.

February 22, 2017: Although the bug of June 19, 2017 (see just above) was corrected
in the LC and DC program files (lc14june2015flop.f and dc22may2015flop.f), somehow  
an old version of dc22may2015flop.f remained on the download site until today. 
File dc22may2015flop.f is now properly corrected. The LC file, lc14june2015flop.f,
has been OK since June 19, 2017. Thanks go to Serguei Leontiev for noticing this bug.

May 31, 2019: Orkun Ozdarcan noticed that light curves written from LC and DC
differed at some phases by about one part in 500 for an analyzed EB. 
This problem turned out to be due to a bug in the LC main program that
has now been fixed. It would not have affected solution results, as there 
was no corresponding bug in the DC program, and the effect on published light
curve graphs was not significant at the typical resolution of journal figures.
